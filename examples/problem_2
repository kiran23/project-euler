Fibanacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

sequence = [0,1]
even = []
n, i, j = 0, 0, 1

while i < 10
  sumi = sequence[i]
  sumj = sequence[j]
  n = sumi + sumj
  sequence.push(n)
  i += 1
  j += 1
end

p sequence
sequence.each do |x|
  if x % 2 == 0
    even.push(x)
  else
  end
end

total = 0

even.each { |sum| total += sum }
p even
p total
